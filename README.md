# Stock Portfolio Optimizer

This is a personal data-analytics project where I built a decision-model in Excel to optimize a simple stock portfolio. It showcases:

- **Linear & Integer-linear programming** using Excel Solver  
- **Sensitivity analysis** to understand how changes in returns affect the optimal allocation  
- A step-by-step walkthrough of model setup, outputs, and interpretation

## üìÇ Project structure

- **data/**  
  - `Tavakoli_Mehdi_224304485_MIS775.xlsx`  
    ‚Äì My Excel workbook with all model formulations, Solver setups, and sensitivity sheets

- **report/**  
  - `Tavakoli_Mehdi_224304485_MIS775.pptx`  
    ‚Äì A concise slide deck that walks through problem definition, model logic, results, and insights


## üöÄ How to explore

1. Open the Excel file in **data/**  
   - Inspect the LP vs. ILP setups  
   - Review Solver‚Äôs optimal allocations and sensitivity outputs

2. Browse the slides in **report/** for a narrated overview of my process and key takeaways

3. Feel free to fork this repo and adapt the model to your own portfolio ideas!

   ## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

1. **Gathered data**: Collected historical stock returns and risk metrics.  
2. **Built LP & ILP models**: Set up allocation constraints in Excel Solver.  
3. **Ran sensitivity analysis**: Tested how portfolio weights shift when returns change.  
4. **Compiled insights**: Summarised optimal allocations and ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios.

## Introduction

I kicked off this side-project by defining the core question:  
> ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the optimal mix of eight ASX-listed stocks to maximise expected return, while keeping risk and sector exposures under control?‚Äù  

This came straight from the guide‚Äôs Purpose & Context, which calls for 48 months of real price data and two optimisation methods‚ÄîLP and ILP.


---

## Data Gathering

1. **Stock Selection**  
   - Started with the four ‚Äúgiven‚Äù tickers (PME, XRO, TLS, CBA)  
   - Added four more from diverse sectors via MarketIndex to capture different volatility profiles  

2. **Fetching Price History**  
   - Used Excel‚Äôs `STOCKHISTORY` function to pull Jan 2021‚ÄìJan 2025 monthly closes:  
     ```  
     =STOCKHISTORY("XASX.PME", "01-01-2021", "01-01-2025", 2, 1, 0, 1)  
     ```

## Calculating Returns & Risk Classification

- **Monthly Returns**  
  \[
    \text{Return}_t = \frac{\text{Close}_t - \text{Close}_{t-1}}{\text{Close}_{t-1}}
  \]  
  formatted to two decimal places.

- **Risk Groups**  
  - Computed each stock‚Äôs average return and standard deviation.  
  - Defined three risk buckets (R1=low vol, R2=medium, R3=high), ensuring at least two assets per bucket.

## LP Model Formulation

Following Section 2 of the guide, I set up a Linear Program to **maximise total return** subject to:

- High-risk assets ‚â§ 15% total  
- Lowest-risk group gets the largest share  
- Each sector ‚â• 15% (one sector forced ‚â• 20%)  
- Each asset ‚â• 5%  
- My own extra ‚Äúdiversity‚Äù rule

I coloured decision cells green and constraint cells blue in Solver, just like in class.

## LP Results & Sensitivity Analysis

- **Solver Sensitivity Report** showing shadow prices and reduced costs  
- Tested ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù tweaks on risk limits to see allocation shifts

## ILP Model Formulation

Per Section 3, I converted to an Integer Linear Program:

- Binary decision \(x_i \in \{0,1\}\) for selecting exactly 5 assets  
- Must include all four sectors  
- At most one from R3, at least two from R1  
- Only allow an R3 pick if at least one R2 is chosen  
- One extra defendable rule of my own  
![Slide16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f843534-bc1e-4789-be90-d9894d574239)
![Slide17](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e34de9b-65d3-471f-a650-21e79f87da6a)

---

## ILP Results

Solver‚Äôs integer run picked the ‚Äúbest 5‚Äù (e.g. TLS, CBA, XRO‚Ä¶) for a **3.6% expected portfolio return**, trading some diversification for a slightly higher yield.

![Slide18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22216980-3832-4925-85e3-ebdc3506dff2)

## Summary & Recommendation

| Approach | Return | Diversification | Notes |
| :------- | :----- | :-------------- | :---- |
| **LP**   | 3.4%   | Smooth across 8 | Balanced, low concentration risk |
| **ILP**  | 3.6%   | Concentrated   | Higher return but more single-stock risk |

**Recommendation:** Use the LP solution for its balanced risk profile and smoother allocations, unless you need that extra 0.2% and can tolerate concentration.
