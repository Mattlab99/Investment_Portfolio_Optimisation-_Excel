# Stock Portfolio Optimizer

This is a personal data-analytics project where I built a decision-model in Excel to optimize a simple stock portfolio. It showcases:

- **Linear & Integer-linear programming** using Excel Solver  
- **Sensitivity analysis** to understand how changes in returns affect the optimal allocation  
- A step-by-step walkthrough of model setup, outputs, and interpretation

## ðŸ“‚ Project structure

- **data/**  
  - `Tavakoli_Mehdi_224304485_MIS775.xlsx`  
    â€“ My Excel workbook with all model formulations, Solver setups, and sensitivity sheets

- **report/**  
  - `Tavakoli_Mehdi_224304485_MIS775.pptx`  
    â€“ A concise slide deck that walks through problem definition, model logic, results, and insights


## ðŸš€ How to explore

1. Open the Excel file in **data/**  
   - Inspect the LP vs. ILP setups  
   - Review Solverâ€™s optimal allocations and sensitivity outputs

2. Browse the slides in **report/** for a narrated overview of my process and key takeaways

3. Feel free to fork this repo and adapt the model to your own portfolio ideas!
